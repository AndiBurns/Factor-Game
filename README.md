# Factor-Game
A strategy game for two players (comp vs. human) about factoring numbers

based on number theory studied at Bridgewater State University

The game starts with a Magic Number. The player can set a Magic Number, or have the game
choose one at random. The game will factor that number automatically,
but the results can be hidden to allow the player to practice factoring, and then shown
to confirm. Gameplay proceeds in turns. First, the comp will select one of the factors
(possibly the number itself), and then all multiples of that factor (including the factor itself)
are eliminated. Next, the player selects a factor that has not yet been eliminated, and all
multiples of that factor are eliminated. Play proceeds back and forth like this until a player
is forced to choose 1 (the losing move).
